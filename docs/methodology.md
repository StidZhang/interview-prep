# Programming Methodology

## Object-oriented Programming

### Objects and classes
Class is the definitions of some data format. Normally contains data members
and member functions. Objects are instances of classes.

Procedures in classes are usually called methods. Variables in classes are
called fields/attributes/properties. For variables, there are two types:
1. Class variables: belong to the whole class; only one copy for each class
2. Instance variables: data belong to each individual objects

Methods also have two types:
1. Class methods: belong to the whole class and only access to class variables.
2. Instance methods: belong to individual object and have access to instance
variables for the specific object that are called on.
